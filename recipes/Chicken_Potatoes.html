    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This one pan baked chicken and potatoes is a great midweek meal to add to your rotation</p>
    <p>No marinate, no fancy ingredients, it's a one pan, simple 
        meal that is ready in an hour. Just toss the chicken 
        thighs, baby potatoes, and chopped onion with olive oil,
        garlic, thyme, dried oregano, paprika, salt and pepper,
         then pop it in the oven. The chicken skin turns very 
         crispy, while the meat stays juicy</p>
